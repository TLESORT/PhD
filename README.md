## Introduction

I am Timothée LESORT, I started my PhD between Thales entreprise and the engineering school ENSTA-ParisTech the 1 june 2017. I mostly share in this repo the papers I have read and like. I have also added some link to ressource I have found useful. The goal is to share my bibliography work with people in the same field, feel free to contact me if your working on the same field :)

## Main Topics : see in [bibliography.md](https://github.com/TLESORT/PhD/blob/master/Bibliography.md) for associated papers 

- Transfer Learning
- Learning To Learn
- Meta Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Incremental/Progressiv/curiculum/Sequential Learning
- One/Few shot-Learning
